        My interest in software development started at age eight, when my parents bought a
        Commodore VIC-20. Suddenly nights and weekends were gobbled up with writing line after 
        line of BASIC code, and saving it to a casette tape. How far we have come.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-300 py-1.5">
        A few years later, when our first desktop arrived, my interest moved into the command line, but by then I was 
        a teenager, and all sorts of other things were competing for my attention.

      <p className="text-slate-300 py-1.5">
        Later, my interest in software was renewed when I saw the importance that applications
        and good UI plays in improving processes, workflows, and business operations.

        Now, a full stack web developer, I love solving problems being faced by businesses,
        and looking for any opportunity to grow knowledge, and apply that for your benefit.

        I am focussing more this year on being better with downtime, and when not at my computer, I am likely spending 
        time with my husband, trying new foods, learning emerging tech, or armchair travelling.
